# belt

A lightweight tool belt for basic daily tasks.

## Getting started

Just install the tool and require it as normal: `var belt = require('belt');`

Alternatively you can require specific modules - e.g. the `stringUtil` modul for useful functions regarding strings. The modules are located in the `lib` folder.

## API

This will be documented once there are more functions and the format is clear.
